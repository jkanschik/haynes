# Haynes catalog [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jkanschik/haynes.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jkanschik/haynes) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jkanschik/haynes.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jkanschik/haynes)

Haynes catalog is an online catalogue for historic oboe music, see (http://haynes-catalog.net).

The current code has been written in 2008 and desperately needs to be rewritten in large parts. One problem being that it requires rails 2.x, which is not acceptable.

This github project is used together with travis and code climate to improve the code step by step, before it's put into production.
